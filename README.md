Friendlier searching and information about Trash pickup times for San Jose

The [current implementation on the San Jose website](https://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?nid=3079) is a bit difficult to use. This project aims to improve the user experience and functionality.

The build will be:
- Python to interface with the Hauler Dataset and featurize the data
- Elastic Search to hold the data and create the search api
- Some type of html-javascript to visualize the search and results


The original data set is [here](http://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?nid=3079).  More info on this problem [here](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/Project-Ideas/issues/54).
